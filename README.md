# School Projects Repository

This repository contains code written for my **CSC231** course, focusing on **Data Structures and Algorithms** using **Python**. Each project is organized into its own directory, showcasing various programming assignments and practical implementations from the course.

## Projects

### 1. Playlist Management System
- **Description**: This project involves managing a playlist of songs, where users can add, remove, and perform operations like shuffling or sorting the playlist. The code is separated into two parts:
  - `playlist.py`: Contains the core logic for the playlist, such as adding, removing songs, and more.
  - `playlist_test.py`: A test suite that runs various unit tests to ensure the playlist functions as expected.
- **Technologies Used**: Python
- **How to Run**:
  - Ensure you have Python installed (version 3.x).
  - Run the main playlist code with: `python playlist.py`.
  - To run the tests, execute: `python playlist_test.py`.

### 2. Olympics Dataset Analysis
- **Description**: This project processes and analyzes a CSV file containing Olympics data. It includes functions to calculate averages, find the minimum and maximum values, and search for specific athletes.
- **Technologies Used**: Python
- **How to Run**:
  - Ensure you have Python installed (version 3.x).
  - Download the dataset and run the script: `python olympics.py`.

*More projects will be added as the course progresses.*
